- To run the codes and replicate the results, please follow the following guidelines:
1- Folder "DRL agent" contains the trained agent and the code used for training and running the model.

2- Folder "LQR" and file "Final code.m" contains the code required for performing LQR-based control.

3- Folder "Nonlinear simulink" containes a simulink model of the original nonlinear model which was used for comparing the performance of the deigned controllers.

4- File "state feedback and PID and root locus.m" containes the codes for running state feedback, PID, and root locus-based controllers.
